# Name of your Map

| Designers | Implemented | GitHub Links |
|---|---|---|
| Your Names Here | :white_check_mark: Yes or :warning: Partially or :information_source: Open PR or :x: No | PR Links or TBD |

`Designers` should be the names that you use on GitHub and/or Discord. This is optional but strongly recommended, since:

- This acknowledges credit where it is due
- People who are confused about the written intent can use this information to contact the authors

`Implemented` is the status of the feature.

Github links can include multiple PRs, if relevant.
