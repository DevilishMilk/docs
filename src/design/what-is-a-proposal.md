# What is a Proposal?

A proposal is a way to put your feature out there to the world. A chance for you to speak uninterrupted and for maintainers at Funky Station to give your feature the proper attention it deserves.

A proposal, given enough care and thought, will be reviewed by the Head Maintainer and other Maintainers. The community may also have a chance to speak up about things they like and do not like about your feature.

# What can a Proposal be about?

A proposal can be about anything you want to add to the game. There are two categories for now, although this might be subject to change.

## A Map Proposal

A map proposal is about adding a map into rotation for Funky Station. This helps maintainers ensure a level of quality when approving new maps, although typically mapping proposals need to go through multiple layers of approval before they are accepted.

The reason for why a mapping proposal may be denied include:

* Significant overhead already added ontop of maintaining several maps
* The mapping proposal is missing key features that is needed for a map to be viable
* The map does not fit into the vision the maintainers have for Funky Station
* The map may not recieve the proper care and support it needs after it is merged
* The map is unfriendly towards crucial features specific to Funky Station

There are a lot of hurdles, and consider these when designing a new map and request that it be added. Maintainers do not want to see a new map get added then forced out of rotation because of little support from the community.

## A Gameplay Proposal

A gameplay proposal is about adding a new feature for players to interact with. This helps maintainers understand the thought put into a feature before it is merged, as well as gives admins the means to understand what your feature is doing and help provide support to players who may ask about it. 

The reason for why a gameplay proposal may be denied include:

* Significant changes to code that may be modified by Upstream
* The gameplay proposal does not fit into the vision the maintainers have for Funky Station
* The gameplay proposal goes against one of the core design principles
* The gameplay proposal is not well thought out enough for certain scenarios
* The gameplay proposal that comes with a PR may have code that is not up to maintainer standard

```admonish question "What exactly is 'not well thought out enough?'"

A gameplay proposal that is "not well thought out enough" is a proposal that makes a significant change to a department or a core part of gameplay, then does not elaborate on how this may affect other systems or departments in the game.

For example, a gameplay proposal that suggests changing Science to another department and describes the features within this new department, excluding the changes that may come with Medical, Command, etc., is a proposal that is not well thought out enough.

This also may fit proposals that are too vague. Usually, a maintainer will spell out why a gameplay proposal is not being merged, so the exact wording will be more specific there.

## What are the chances my proposal gets accepted?

To be truthful, we won't know until you propose it. We can give you some expectations though.

A mapping proposal will have a much harder time getting through because of the significance a map has to the game. Players remember good maps, and players *especially remember* maps that they do not enjoy.

A gameplay proposal might have an easier time getting through, especially if a demo PR is already made and tested, although this isn't to say cool things won't get merged because they need work done for them to work.
